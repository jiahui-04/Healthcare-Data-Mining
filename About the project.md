# Healthcare Data Mining and Synthetic EHR Generation
SC4020 - Data Analytics and Mining (Group Project)

## Project Overview
This project explores pattern mining and synthetic data generation techniques on real-world healthcare datasets. It consists of three main components:
1. symptom co-occurrence analysis using association rule mining,
2. cancer feature pattern mining using sequential pattern mining, and
3. synthetic electronic health record (EHR) generation using deep generative models.
The goal is to uncover meaningful medical patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models in generating high-quality synthetic healthcare data while preserving statistical properties.
